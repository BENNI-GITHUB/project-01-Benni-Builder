## Design
### Colour Scheme
![Colours used](https://github.com/BENNI-GITHUB/project-01-Benni-Builder/blob/main/assets/framework/colors.png)
I wanted to Green and dark yellow palette for this site, utilizing the white/grey background as much as possible. 
### Typography
* 'Roboto' is the font used for the Header and Footer of the site with san serif used a fallback. This font is simple and easy to read while adding a modern quality.
* 'Exo' is the font used for the other content of the site with san serif used a fallback. This font is elegent when used sparingly through the site. 
### Imagery
Visual representations are an important part of the user experience for this project, used to draw a potential client in. 
* The welcome area image is just a hand hold a wrench to show the website aim, tried to make it as simple and significant. 
* The Service categories pages are containing images which show the job according to description written next to them. 
* The logo in the header is used to build the business brand, it is created by myself for this project.
### Overall Feel
The main objective in creating the site was to have it look elegant and simplistic while still providing the user with all of the information that may need.

#### Am I Responsive?
When there were devices/browsers that I didn't have access to, I used "amiresponsive" website to make sure that the site was responsive. 

### Third-Party Testing
One of the most helpful ways for me to test throughout his projects was to have a few different people test the site on various devices. I chose a slect group based on their various ages/backgrounds to be able to recieve well-rounded feedback.

| Name | Age | Business BG | Tech BG |
| ------------- |-------------| -----| --- |
| Brian Boggis | 75 | High | Med |
| Eshragh | 38 | Med | High |
| Amir | 32 | High | Low |
| Dolly | 74 | Low | Med |


## Development

### Development through VS Code
At the initial point and because of poor quality of Internet, I used VS Code to write the codes and when the base of the website created I copied the pages and assets to Codenywhere.

### Development through Codeanywhere
I used codeanywhere platform to modify my codes.
This way helped me to save my time and gave me opportunity to develop my website offline.


## Bugs & Fixes
* Videos were not opened and the first time.
  * After reveiwing the lessons I changed the codes and split out the source attribute and it solved.
* Using lable & input for menu was challenging.
  * I changed the position of the input and collapsed menu in HTML, It led to the input read the next one.
